kubernetes allows you to handle secrets. And guess what ? k9s also helps us on that side ! 👽️

## Can you guess what my secret is ?
I've added a secret undernamespace falco, with name dev-db-secret, can you find which password I use ?



- add a secret with kubectl
- visualize current secrets
- Decode given secret
