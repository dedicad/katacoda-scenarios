[Popeye](https://popeyecli.io/) is an open-source tool that helps you sanitize your cluster ü§óÔ∏è
At the top, you can notice a global score (58 - Category E for api namespace in review cluster).

For example, Popeye allows you to see : 
- Unused Service accounts
- Unhealthy ReplicatSets


Popeye does not do any actions on your behalf on the cluster, it just lists you the problematic ressources.
Try 
```
pop all
```{{execute T1}}
