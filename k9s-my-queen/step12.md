Waouh k9s is pretty neat ! But I I feel there's a little bit too much on my screen I'am lost !


No problem ! k9s is fully configurable, actually I just added a config file in $HOME/.k9s/views.yml so now try to do 
```
pods all
```{{execute T1}}
Have a look : 
```
vim ~/.k9s/plugin.yml
```{{execute T2}}

More info [in the official docs](https://k9scli.io/topics/columns/)

### Config

You can also see the file $HOME/.k9s/config.yml to see what a lot of parameters you can adjust, for example : 
- Toggle timestamp on logs by default
- sinceSeconds to choose the default past logs to see (default 5 minutes)

## Optionnnal : if you have time

### Custom Shortcuts
üñêÔ∏è Ok ok, but this is a bit log to access the screen I want to see. 

Yes so you can a hotkey file in $HOME/.k9s/hotkey.yml ! I've added one for you, try to press the touch "m"

This should get you directly to containers of namespace falco ! 
Have a look at the config file : 
```
vim ~/.k9s/hotkey.yml
```{{execute T2}}

### Custom commands
You can add your own shortcuts ! For example if you want to see the logs of a pod with a different command, let's say ctrl+l. I've added a $HOME/.k9s/plugin.yml file to do so. Give it a look !
```
vim ~/.k9s/plugin.yml
```{{execute T2}}

### Skins
Oh and if I don't like the colors ?

You can use personnalized skins !
