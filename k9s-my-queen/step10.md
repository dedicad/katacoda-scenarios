Allright ! You're starting to get your hands on k9s ! 

Next question, what if I need to admnister 2 different clusters ? Let's say review and production for example 😇️


Well you just have to use the 
```
context
```{{execute T1}}
command !


Ok you're right, this was an easy step, since I didn't want to build 2 clusters here 😂️
Just something to remember, k9s (actually kube) remembers where you where before switching cluster, so that you will end back on the same namespace as the last time for example  🤗️
